        Back when I upgraded to Windows 10 I was happy about many things, but one app where I felt Microsoft was going backwards was the default "Photos" app. It's slow to load, slow to use, tries to create a catalogue of all my pictures, not to mention the constant connections it attempts to make to Microsoft's servers. 
         
        I just wanted it to open a folder, get out of the way, and just show me the pictures!
         
        
        I often think that less is more. So here is an image viewer that instead of doing more, does less:

        * **Less UI** means that your photos take all the space and there's no awkward buttons and menus crowding the screen

        * **Less time waiting**: ImageViewer is really fast, even on slower external hard drives and memory cards

        * **~~Less~~ *Absolutely no* spying**: ImageViewer does not "call home", "collect usage statistics" or creepily track any info about you or your photos
         
        Best of all, ImageViewer is ü§ë free and [‚ù§ open source](https://github.com/LBognanni/CodeMadeClock/)
